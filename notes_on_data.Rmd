# Data Literacy: A Data 101 Training for Juvenile Probation Staff
`r today() %>% format("%m-%d-%y")`

#Training Ground Rules
*  Take care of your clients and cases  
*  Two breaks are built in, but get up and go if you got to go
*  Ask questions, even ones that seem obvious
*  Be willing to be challenged

#Learning Objectives:
*  To become fluent with the language of data
*  To think critically about data
*  To become familiar with the fundamentals of OUR data
    + What we collect
    + How we collect it
    + Why we need it
*  What we can do to improve our Data Quality
*  To discover what you want to learn next

# Expectations
![What do you want to learn today?](imgs/schoolHouseRock.gif)

# What Is Data?
![What questions do you have about data?](imgs/howdoyouusedata.gif)

## Excercise 1: How do you use data?
![Bro-map](imgs/bro.gif)

*  Take five minutes to note how you use personal **or** probation data
*  Can be alone or in a group

# Data or Information
*  Data: Facts, figures, and other abstract representations of the world

*  Information: Data that has been processed, given structure, and context

# Do we need data?
*  Personal Experience
*  Professional/Clinical Judgement
    +*Challenging it can be easily interpreted as a personal attack*


## Fundamentals of Data
*  Think of data and information as a new language that requires fluency
*  **slide by slide comparison here**

# The Language of Data
## Types of Data
### Quantitative
*  Discrete: only specific values matter for that data
*  Continuous: All values
*  *Examples?*
  
### Qualitative
*  Binary: Yes/No
*  Nominal: Names with no particular meaning
*  Ordinal: Scores or Ranks
*  Count/Ratio: Items per Area/Volume
*  *Examples?*



## Descriptive Statistics
>  "Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire or sample population. Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread)."

* Descriptive statistics describe the population or sample

### Measures of Central Tendency and Variablity
* Mean: Average
* Median: Equal point in the distribution
* Mode: Most Frequent number
* Range: Minimum number to maximum number
* Variance: How spread out the data points are
* Standard Deviation: The distance, in the same unit, between data points

### Example
```{r, TrickQuestion_one, include= TRUE, echo = F}
total_height_bar
```

```{r, TrickQuestion_two, include= TRUE, echo = F}
total_height
```

```{r, trickquestionThree, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
bad_proof
```

### Chart Example
```{r, badchart, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
bad_height %>% kable() %>% kable_styling("striped", "bordered", full_width = TRUE)
```
### Excercise: How did I mislead you?
* Look at the graphs below and point out what you would do different?

```{r, side_by_side, include = TRUE, warning = FALSE, fig.show = "asis", echo = FALSE}
total_height
total_height_bar
```

### Correct Way to Visualize
```{r, correct_viz, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

total_height_sex_histogram
total_height_chart %>% kable(caption = "All Measurements in cm") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped", "bordered", full_width = FALSE)
  
```
*The previous chart and graph will be on a single slide*

# Take a break

# Quick Recap
* Measures of Central Tendency.
* Measures of Variance.
* How to think critically about data?

# The Stastical Model
* A representation of what the data tells us
* The goal of:
  + Big Data
  + Machine Learning
  + AI
  + **Other buzzwords?**

## Four Kinds of Analytics
* Descriptive: What
* Diagnostic: Why? 
* Predictive: What if?
* Prescriptive: Best course?

### Diagnostic Analytics
* Why did this happen?
![Do not be afraid to ask why.](imgs/why.gif)

### Predictive Analytics
* What could happen
  + Chances of winning an election
  + Chances of developing an illness
  + Chance at re-offending
  
### Examples

## Perscriptive  Analytics
* What is the best course of action?

### Excercise: Examples of Perscriptive Statistics

# How does we collect data or information?
* Personal Experiences
* TV
* Newspapers
* Radio
* Conversations
* Comparison shopping
* Google


# How does the Court collect data?
* Forms
* Reports
* Studies
* JEMS
* I-Clear
* Clerks
* Promise
* Databases
* *Spreadsheets*

# Tidy Data
![Thanks Hadley!](imgs/hadley.jpg)

* Each variable forms a column.
* Each observation forms a row.
* Each cell is atomic.
* Each type of observational unit forms a table.

# Examples of Spreadsheet USe
* We use spreadsheets for:
  + Collection, cleaning, results, analysis
  + Provide structure to our data
  + Share data/information
  + Data Analysis

# Excercise 2: Critique this spreadsheet
![Made up data: Also a handout.](imgs/fakeSheet.png)

# Excercise 2: Results 2
* Cells are not atomic
* Missing values
* Variable formats within entries

# Why we need data
* Evidence Based Practices
* Performance based budgeting
* Risk Level and Classification


# Where Do We Go From Here
* We have the language, now what are the goals

## Excercise
* With your table, discuss where you want to go from here
* Use your SMART goals!

# Closing
