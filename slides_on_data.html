*  To become fluent with the language of data

*  To think critically about data

*  To become familiar with the fundamentals of OUR data
    + What we collect
    + How we collect it
    + Why we need it
*  What we can do to improve our Data Quality

*  To discover what you want to learn next

# Descriptive Statistics

&gt;  "Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire or sample population. Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread)."

.right[[--Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/descriptive_statistics.asp)]

---
# Measures of Central Tendency and Variability


* Mean: Average
--


* Median: Equal point in the distribution
--


* Mode: Most frequent number
--


* Range: Minimum number to maximum number


???
* Ask why these are useful measures for us
* point to JDAI stats, detention stats
* dis-aggregating data by race was a huge push for JDAI, what else should we separate?

# Terms in Practice: With Height!

  + In inches
  
* We will [calculate](https://allcomicsconsideredstats.shinyapps.io/shiny_mean/):
--

  + *Range: Minimum number to maximum number.*
  
  + *Mean: Add up all the numbers, divide by the amount of entries.*
  
  + *Median: Mid point in the heights*
  
  + *Mode: Most frequent number*

# The Statistical Model

* The goal of:

  + Big Data

  + Machine Learning

  + AI

Actuarial vs Statistical model discussion can occur.

* Actuarial instruments attach specific statistical weighting to different variables which assess the risk.
* A key defining aspect of actuarial instruments is that scores obtained on individuals can be related to statistical reference data.
* ARAI are based on stats and stat modeling and work on predictive, whre stat models work on work on classifcation, predictive, and prescriptive

# Four Kinds of Analytics

* Descriptive: What?
    + Very similar to descriptive statistics.
    + Examples of probation descriptive statistics?

* Diagnostic: Why? 

* Predictive: What if?

* Prescriptive: Best course?
---
## Diagnostic Analytics

.center[![Do not be afraid to ask why.](imgs/why.gif)]

* Why has the number of violations increased in this district?  

* Why did this happen?  

* What kind of diagnostic questions should we ask?

---
## Predictive Analytics
* What could happen

  + Chances of winning an election

  + Chances of developing an illness

  + Chance at re-offending
--


.center[![:scale 60%](imgs/superimportantoutcome.png)]

  + What is the chance of this specific young person re offending?
---
# Prescriptive  Analytics
* What is the best course of action?
.center[![The Process](imgs/Prescriptive_Analytics_process.png)]

* What is the best service/intervention for this young person to reduce their level of risk?

---
## Exercise 3: Discussion of Prescriptive Statistics

.center[![:scale 70%](imgs/scrouge.gif)]

* This is what all of our models are attempting to answer

# How do we collect data or information?

* Personal Experiences

* TV

* Newspapers 

* Radio

* Conversations

* Comparison shopping

* Google

* Facebook
---
# How does the *Court* collect data?

* Forms
--


* Reports
--


* Studies
--

* JEMS/C5/Supervisor

* Assessment Tools

#How do we store Data

* Word Documents 

* Databases
--

* *Spreadsheets*

.center[![:scale 45%](imgs/eyeore.jpg)]

.center[# Spreadsheet Use]
* We use spreadsheets for:

  + Collection, cleaning, results, analysis

  + Provide structure to our data

  + Share data/information

  + Data Analysis

---
.center[# Spreadsheet Use]
* In our office we use
  + Excel (2003, 2007, 2013, 2016)
  
  + Google Sheets

  + And, occasionally, tables in Word

  + What should we use Spreadsheets for?
???
* who uses them
* who doesn't
* who wants a training?
---
.center[# Tidy Data]
* Each variable forms a column.

* Each observation forms a row.

* Each cell is "atomic."

* Each type of observational unit forms a table.

# Exercise 4: Critique This Spreadsheet
.center[![:scale 95%](imgs/fakeSheet.png)]
???
* This spreadsheet will be a handout
* TEAM Work
* 10-15 minutes
* The image will remain on screens
---
# Exercise 4: Takeaways

* Cells are not "atomic"

* Missing values

* Variable formats within entries
---
# Why Do We Need Data: Takeaways

* Evidence Based Practices

* Performance based budgeting

* Risk Level and Classification


--
# Data is a langauge that we need to become fluent in.
 
---
# Where Do We Go From Here
* We have the language, now what are *our* goals?
--

* With your table, discuss where you want to go from here.
  + **Everyone must have a role**
  + Start with a question you need data to answer
  + What descriptive and diagnostic analyses do you need?
      - What kind of analysis do you want to conduct?
  + Report back to the group
    + No longer than 60 seconds!

* Use your SMART goals!
???
This is supposed to be the L2 activity: ensure that people are leaving understanding some of this data.
