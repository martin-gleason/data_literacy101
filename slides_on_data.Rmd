# Materials needed for in-person training:
* paper for notes/exercises
* 5 + attendees copy of bad spreadsheet data

.center[#Learning Objectives:]

*  To become fluent with the language of data

*  To think critically about data

*  To become familiar with the fundamentals of OUR data
    + What we collect
    + How we collect it
    + Why we need it
*  What we can do to improve our Data Quality

*  To discover what you want to learn next
???
Icebreaker Exercise instructions: 
* Have everyone line up by birthday, descending, without speaking
* the point is to illustrate how critical language is to easy exchange of knowledge

# Types of Data

## Qualitative

*  Binary: Yes/No

*  Nominal: Names with no particular meaning

*  Ordinal: Scores or Ranks

*  Count/Ratio: Items per Area/Volume

*  *Examples?*

# Descriptive Statistics

>  "Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire or sample population. Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread)."

.right[[--Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/descriptive_statistics.asp)]

---
# Measures of Central Tendency and Variablity


* Mean: Average
--


* Median: Equal point in the distribution
--


* Mode: Most frequent number
--


* Range: Minimum number to maximum number
--


* Variance: How spread out the data points are
--


* Standard Deviation: The distance, in the same unit, between data points

???
* Ask why these are useful measures for us
* point to JDAI stats, detention stats
* dis-aggregating data by race was a huge push for JDAI, what else should we separate?

## Measures of Central Tendency with Height
