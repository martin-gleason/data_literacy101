# Descriptive Statistics

>  "Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire or sample population. Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread)."

.right[[--Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/descriptive_statistics.asp)]

---
# Measures of Central Tendency and Variablity


* Mean: Average
--


* Median: Equal point in the distribution
--


* Mode: Most frequent number
--


* Range: Minimum number to maximum number
--

* Other measures of central tendency include:
  
  + Variance
  + Standard Deviation
  + Standard error of the Mean
  + Beyond the scope of today's training

???
* Ask why these are useful measures for us
* point to JDAI stats, detention stats
* dis-aggregating data by race was a huge push for JDAI, what else should we separate?

# Four Kinds of Analytics

* Descriptive: What?
    + Very similar to descriptive statistics.
    + Examples of probation descriptive statistics?

* Diagnostic: Why? 

* Predictive: What if?

* Prescriptive: Best course?

## Diagnostic Analytics

.center[![Do not be afraid to ask why.](imgs/why.gif)]

* Why has the number of violations increased in this district?  

* Why did this happen?  
* What kind of diagnostic questions should we ask?

---
## Predictive Analytics
* What could happen

  + Chances of winning an election

  + Chances of developing an illness

  + Chance at re-offending

  + What is the chance of this specific young person re offending?

# Perscriptive  Analytics

.center[# Spreadsheet Use]
* We use spreadsheets for:

  + Collection, cleaning, results, analysis

  + Provide structure to our data

  + Share data/information

  + Data Analysis

* In our office, we use Excel
  + Google Sheets

  + And, occasionally, tables in Word

# Exercise 4: Takeaways

* Cells are not atomic

* Missing values

* Variable formats within entries
---
# Why Do We Need Data: Takeaways

* Evidence Based Practices

* Performance based budgeting

* Risk Level and Classification
---
# Where Do We Go From Here
* We have the language, now what are *our* goals?
--

* With your table, discuss where you want to go from here.

  + Start with a question you want to answer
  + What descriptive and diagnostic analyses do you need?
  + Everyone must have a role
  + Report back to the group
    + No longer than 60 seconds!

* Use your SMART goals!
