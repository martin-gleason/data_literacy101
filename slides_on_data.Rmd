## The Bro-Map!

* Takes multiple kinds of data
  * GPS
  * Natural Language/Linguistic
  * Maps!
  
* Visualizes new information
  * What slang is is used where
  
   
* How could this be useful?
  * Marketers
  * Demographers/Researchers
     * Examining how concepts spread through the culture

# Data or Information: What's the Difference?
  
.left[Data: 
* Facts, figures, and other abstract representations of the world
  + Height/Weight

  + Number of Charges

  + Length of Term of Probation

  + Demographics
  
* Data is a mathematical representation of the real world]

???
Data and information are often used interchangeably. For our purposes, I am suggesting we have stricter definintions of data and information so we can expand our data tool box. WE'll use data to mean facts, figures, and represetnations that lack structure and context. 
---
class: center
# Data or Information
.left[Information:
* Data that has been processed, structure, and context
  + Reports
 
  + Charts and graphs

  + Risk Level

      - Credit

      - Census

  + Body Mass Index (BMI)

      - [Far From Perfect Model](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106268439)]
      
???
We'll define infomration as data that has been processed and transformed. 
Graphs, charts, models. This is our data given structure and context so we can make better decisions.

# Data Vs Experience

* **This is a false choice**
  * Personal Experience is personal data
  
  * Properly collected data represents multiple views
  
  * If personal experience varies from the data, it leads to great questions and avenues to explore
  
    + It does not mean the data is bad
???
I don't need data, I have my experiences.
---
# Data Vs Experience

* Ignore data and information at your peril

--
* Being critical of data collection and transformation is increasingly important in our society

  + Being critical is not the same as rejecting all data

* Your experiences are vital to the discussion. So is the data.

# How much data do we need?

* Why not just collect all the data?
  * Security
  * Cost in processing
  * Storage cost is not typically an issue
    + But data privacy laws are
 
* **A better question is: What data do we need?**

if data is so great, why don't we capture all of it?

# Types of Data
## Quantitative
 **This maybe on a quiz...**

*  Discrete: only specific values matter for that data

*  Continuous: All values

*  *Examples?*

--
  + Height
  
  
--
  + Weight


--
  + Age


--
  + Income Data
  
  
--
  + Blood Pressure
???
Quantative == Numeric

---
# Types of Data

## Qualitative

*  Binary: Yes/No

*  Nominal: Names with no particular meaning

*  Ordinal: Scores or Ranks

*  Count/Ratio: Items per Area/Volume

*  *Examples?*
--

  + Geographic Location/GPS
  
  + 2016 Polling Data
  
  + Tax Bracket
???
Qualities == Categorical

---
# Types of Data
## Probation Specific Examples

* Quantitative Examples

--
  + Number of youth on probation
  
  + Number of Violations
    + By Officer
    
  + Number of service agencies

# Types of Data
## Probation Specific Examples

* Qualitative Examples

--
  + What services is the young person ordered to attend?
  
  + Violations of Probation

* How much do you drink every morning
  
  + In discrete terms.
  + In continuous terms.

# Descriptive Statistics

>  "Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire or sample population. Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread)."

.right[[--Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/descriptive_statistics.asp)]

---
# Measures of Central Tendency and Variability


* Mean: Average
--


* Median: Equal point in the distribution
--


* Mode: Most frequent number
--


* Range: Minimum number to maximum number


???
* Ask why these are useful measures for us
* point to JDAI stats, detention stats
* dis-aggregating data by race was a huge push for JDAI, what else should we separate?
---

# Terms in Practice: [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) App

* Use this web app to [calculate](https://allcomicsconsideredstats.shinyapps.io/shiny_mean/) mean, median, mode and range.

## Instructions

* Enter whole numbers

* Separate numbers with white space

  * 44 56 
  
  * not 44, 56
  
The app will give you the measures of central tendency and a chart

---
```{r rnorm, include = TRUE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
source("scripts/rnorm_plot.R")
df_plot
```

## Best Practices: Visualization
```{r correct_viz, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10, message = FALSE}

total_height_sex_histogram +
    theme(panel.spacing = unit(5, "lines"))+
  facet_grid(~ Sex)+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(family = "Nobile", size = 20 ),
        axis.title = element_text(family = "Nobile", size = 20 ),
        legend.text = element_text(family = "Nobile", size = 20),
        legend.title = element_text(family = "Nobile", size = 20))

total_height_chart %>% kable(caption = "All Measurements in Inches") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped", "bordered", full_width = FALSE)

# The Statistical Model

* A mathematical representation of what ALL the data tells us

* Is the corner stone of:

  + Big Data
  + Machine Learning
  + AI
  + Risk Assessments
      + Including: JRA, YASI, and JSOAP
.center[![:scale 52%](imgs/boosting-algo-7.gif)]
???
Actuarial vs Statistical model discussion can occur.

* Actuarial instruments attach specific statistical weighting to different variables which assess the risk.
* A key defining aspect of actuarial instruments is that scores obtained on individuals can be related to statistical reference data.
* ARAI are based on stats and stat modeling and work on predictive, where stat models work on work on classification, predictive, and prescriptive

# Four Kinds of Analytics

* Descriptive: What?
    + Very similar to descriptive statistics
--

* Diagnostic: Why?
    + Next step model creation
--

* Predictive: What if?
    + What many models are created for
--

* Prescriptive: Best course?
    + The end goal
    
???
Analytics are information that give insight.
---
## Diagnostic Analytics

.center[![Do not be afraid to ask why.](imgs/why.gif)]

* Why did this happen?

* Why has the number of violations increased in this district?  

    + What kind of diagnostic questions should we ask?
???
Determing why something occurs, or goes a certain way, has been at the forefront of science for a long time.
---
## Predictive Analytics
* What could happen.

  +  Focus on the probabilities of *an event occuring*

* Chances of winning an election

* Chances of developing an illness

* Chance at re-offending
--


.center[![:scale 60%](imgs/superimportantoutcome.png)]

  + What is the chance of this specific young person re offending?
???
Focus on the outcome of specific events, like reoffending
---
# Prescriptive  Analytics
* What is the best course of action?
.center[![The Process](imgs/Prescriptive_Analytics_process.png)]

* What is the best service/intervention for this young person to reduce their level of risk?
???
GPS directions/ Best route
---
## Exercise 3: Discussion of Prescriptive Statistics
--

.center[![:scale 70%](imgs/scrouge.gif)]

* This is what all of our models are attempting to answer
???
Case planning is our attempt to make prescriptive action.
---
# How do we collect data or information?
--

* Personal Experiences

* TV

* Newspapers 

* Radio

* Conversations

* Comparison shopping

* Google

* Facebook
???
How we find stuff out. Where we get out data points.
---
# How does the *Court* collect data?

* Forms
--


* Reports
--


* Studies
--

* JEMS/C5/Supervisor

* Assessment Tools
--

* Other Systems
    + I-Clear
    + Clerks
    + Crimes (State's Attorneys)
    + Schools
    + Hospital
    + Promise
???
Some of this data comes in data dumps
some of this is machine readable
some human readable

#How do we store Data

* Word Documents 

* Databases
--

* *Spreadsheets*
--


.center[![:scale 45%](imgs/eyeore.jpg)]
???
When you get data you have to put it somewhere
sometimes that is a spreadsheet, sometimes it is a report. How we store data matters: 

Think of your taxes. if you have a lot of reciepts in a lot of locations, it will take a long time to get ready for your deductions. 
---
# How We Store Data

* Tabular Data
  + Data in a table format

* Word Document/Text is for reporting, not storing raw data

* Does not do basic Spreadsheet Functions

.center[![:scale 45%](imgs/word_table.gif)]
???
Spreadsheets are both machine readable and human readable, not because of the table format, but becausae of their ubiquity. Organized.
---
.center[# Spreadsheet Use]
* In the Juvenile Probation Office we use
  + Excel (2003, 2007, 2013, 2016)

* We use spreadsheets for:

  + Collection, cleaning, results, analysis

  + Provide structure to our data

  + Share data/information

  + Data Analysis

---
# Tidy Data
* Each variable forms a column.

* Each observation forms a row.

* Each cell is "atomic."

* Each type of observational unit forms a table.
