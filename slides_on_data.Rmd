.center[#Training Ground Rules]

*  Take care of your clients and cases

*  Two breaks are built in, but get up and go if you need to

*  Ask questions, even ones that seem obvious

*  Be willing to be challenged
---
.center[#Learning Objectives:]

*  To become fluent with the language of data

*  To think critically about data

*  To become familiar with the fundamentals of OUR data
    + What we collect
    + How we collect it
    + Why we need it
*  What we can do to improve our Data Quality

*  To discover what you want to learn next

# Descriptive Statistics

>  "Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire or sample population. Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread)."

.right[[--Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/descriptive_statistics.asp)]

---
# Measures of Central Tendency and Variablity

* Mean: Average
--


* Median: Equal point in the distribution
--


* Mode: Most frequent number
--


* Range: Minimum number to maximum number
--


* Variance: How spread out the data points are
--


* Standard Deviation: The distance, in the same unit, between data points

# Total Height
```{r, TrickQuestion_one, include= TRUE, echo = F, fig.align='center', fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8,message = FALSE}
total_height_bar
```
---
class:center
## Density of Height
```{r, TrickQuestion_two, include= TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8, echo = F}
total_height
```
---
class:center
## Measures of Central Tendency with Height
```{r, trickquestionThree, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8, message = FALSE}
bad_proof
```
---
## Chart Example
```{r, badchart, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6, message = FALSE}
bad_height %>% kable() %>% kable_styling("striped", "bordered", full_width = TRUE)
```
---
## Excercise 2: How did I mislead you?
```{r, side_by_side, include = TRUE, warning = FALSE, out.width="49%", fig.height = 15, fig.width = 15, fig.show = "hold", message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
total_height + theme(axis.text = element_text(family = "Nobile", size = 48 ),
        axis.title = element_text(family = "Nobile", size = 48 ))

total_height_bar + theme(axis.text = element_text(family = "Nobile", size = 48 ),
        axis.title = element_text(family = "Nobile", size = 48 ))
```
---
## Correct Way to Visualize
```{r, correct_viz, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%", message = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, message = FALSE}

total_height_sex_histogram
total_height_chart %>% kable(caption = "All Measurements in cm") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped", "bordered", full_width = FALSE)

```

# Four Kinds of Analytics

* Descriptive: What?
    + Very similiar to descriptive statistics.

* Diagnostic: Why? 

* Predictive: What if?

* Prescriptive: Best course?

## Diagnostic Analytics
* Why did this happen?

## Predictive Analytics
* What could happen

  + Chances of winning an election

  + Chances of developing an illness

  + Chance at re-offending

.center[# Tidy Data]
* Each variable forms a column.
* Each observation forms a row.
* Each cell is atomic.
* Each type of observational unit forms a table.

.center[# Spreadsheet Use]
* We use spreadsheets for:

  + Collection, cleaning, results, analysis

  + Provide structure to our data

  + Share data/information

  + Data Analysis

* In our office, we use Excel
  + Google Sheets

  + And, occassionally, tables in Word

  + What should we use Spreadsheets for?
