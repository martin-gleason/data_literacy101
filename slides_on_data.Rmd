*  To become fluent with the language of data

*  To think critically about data

*  To become familiar with the fundamentals of OUR data
    + What we collect
    + How we collect it
    + Why we need it
*  What we can do to improve our Data Quality

*  To discover what you want to learn next

## The Bro-Map!

* Takes multiple kinds of data
  * GPS
  * Natural Language/Linguistic
  * Maps!
  
* Visualizes new information
  * What slang is is used where
  
   
* How could this be useful?
  * Marketers
  * Demographers/Researchers
     * Examining how concepts spread through the culture

# Data Vs Experience

* **This is a false choice**
  * Personal Experience is personal data
  
  * Properly collected data represents multiple views
  
  * If personal experience varies from the data, it leads to great questions and avenues to explore
  
    + It does not mean the data is bad
  
---
# Data Vs Experience

* Ignore data and information at your peril

--
* Being critical of data collection and transformation is increasingly important in our society

  + Being critical is not the same as rejecting all data

* Your experiences are vital to the discussion. So is the data.

# How much data do we need?

* Why not just collect all the data?
  * Security
  * Cost in processing
  * Storage cost is not typically an issue
    + But data privacy laws are
 
* **A better question is: What data do we need?**

# Types of Data
## Quantitative

*  Discrete: only specific values matter for that data

*  Continuous: All values

*  *Examples?*

--
  + Height
  
  
--
  + Weight


--
  + Age


--
  + Income Data
  
  
--
  + Blood Pressure
---
# Types of Data

## Qualitative

*  Binary: Yes/No

*  Nominal: Names with no particular meaning

*  Ordinal: Scores or Ranks

*  Count/Ratio: Items per Area/Volume

*  *Examples?*
--

  + Geographic Location/GPS
  
  + 2016 Election
  
  + Tax Bracket
---
# Types of Data
## Probation Specific Examples

* Quantitative Examples

--
  + Number of youth on probation
  
  + Number of Violations
    + By Officer
    
  + Number of service agencies

# Types of Data
## Probation Specific Examples

* Qualitative Examples

--
  + What services is the young person ordered to attend?
  
  + Violations of Probation

# Descriptive Statistics

>  "Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire or sample population. Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread)."

.right[[--Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/descriptive_statistics.asp)]

---
# Measures of Central Tendency and Variability


* Mean: Average
--


* Median: Equal point in the distribution
--


* Mode: Most frequent number
--


* Range: Minimum number to maximum number


???
* Ask why these are useful measures for us
* point to JDAI stats, detention stats
* dis-aggregating data by race was a huge push for JDAI, what else should we separate?
---

# Terms in Practice: [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) App

* Use this web app to [calculate](https://allcomicsconsideredstats.shinyapps.io/shiny_mean/) mean, median, mode and range.

## Instructions

* Enter whole numbers

* Separate numbers with white space

  * 44 56 
  
  * not 44, 56
  
The app will give you the measures of central tendency and a chart
---
## Best Practices: Visualization
```{r correct_viz, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10, message = FALSE}

total_height_sex_histogram +
    theme(panel.spacing = unit(5, "lines"))+
  facet_grid(~ Sex)+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(family = "Nobile", size = 20 ),
        axis.title = element_text(family = "Nobile", size = 20 ),
        legend.text = element_text(family = "Nobile", size = 20),
        legend.title = element_text(family = "Nobile", size = 20))

total_height_chart %>% kable(caption = "All Measurements in Inches") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped", "bordered", full_width = FALSE)

```
???
* ask if there are other questions or points to this graph
* point to the scales as another aspect to be critical of
*

# The Statistical Model

* A mathematical representation of what ALL the data tells us

* Is a huge part of:

  + Big Data
  + Machine Learning
  + AI
  + Risk Assessments
      + Including: JRA, YASI, and JSOAP
.center[![:scale 52%](imgs/boosting-algo-7.gif)]
???

Actuarial vs Statistical model discussion can occur.

* Actuarial instruments attach specific statistical weighting to different variables which assess the risk.
* A key defining aspect of actuarial instruments is that scores obtained on individuals can be related to statistical reference data.
* ARAI are based on stats and stat modeling and work on predictive, where stat models work on work on classification, predictive, and prescriptive

# Four Kinds of Analytics

* Descriptive: What?
    + Very similar to descriptive statistics
--

* Diagnostic: Why?
    + Next step model creation
--

* Predictive: What if?
    + What many models are created for
--

* Prescriptive: Best course?
    + The end goal
---
## Diagnostic Analytics

.center[![Do not be afraid to ask why.](imgs/why.gif)]

* Why did this happen?

* Why has the number of violations increased in this district?  

    + What kind of diagnostic questions should we ask?

---
## Predictive Analytics
* What could happen.

  +  Focus on the probabilities of *an event occuring*

* Chances of winning an election

* Chances of developing an illness

* Chance at re-offending
--


.center[![:scale 60%](imgs/superimportantoutcome.png)]

  + What is the chance of this specific young person re offending?
---
# Prescriptive  Analytics
* What is the best course of action?
.center[![The Process](imgs/Prescriptive_Analytics_process.png)]

* What is the best service/intervention for this young person to reduce their level of risk?

## Exercise 3: Discussion of Prescriptive Statistics

# How do we collect data or information?
--

* Personal Experiences

* TV

* Newspapers 

* Radio

* Conversations

* Comparison shopping

* Google

* Facebook
---
# How does the *Court* collect data?

* Forms
--


* Reports
--


* Studies
--

* JEMS/C5/Supervisor

* Assessment Tools
--

* Other Systems
    + I-Clear
    + Clerks
    + Crimes (State's Attorneys)
    + Schools
    + Hospital
    + Promise

#How do we store Data

* Word Documents 

* Databases
--

* *Spreadsheets*
--


.center[![:scale 45%](imgs/eyeore.jpg)]
---
# How We Store Data

* Tabular Data
  + Data in a table format

* Word Document/Text is for reporting, not storing raw data

* Does not do basic Spreadsheet Functions

.center[![:scale 45%](imgs/word_table.gif)]

---
.center[# Spreadsheet Use]
* In our office we use
  + Excel (2003, 2007, 2013, 2016)

* We use spreadsheets for:

  + Collection, cleaning, results, analysis

  + Provide structure to our data

  + Share data/information

  + Data Analysis

---
# Tidy Data
* Each variable forms a column.

* Each observation forms a row.

* Each cell is "atomic."

* Each type of observational unit forms a table.

# Why Do We Need Data: Recap

* Evidence Based Practices

* Performance based budgeting

* Risk Level and Classification

# Data is a langauge that we need to become fluent in.
